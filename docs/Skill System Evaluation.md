# Skill System Evaluation

> **Status note (2026-05-31):** This is a historical pre-integration evaluation. See [Skill System Status](./Skill%20System%20Status.md) for the current source of truth.


**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Branch:** `claude/evaluate-skill-system-BYqXi`
**Evaluator:** Claude Code

## Executive Summary

Historical finding from 2026-01-23: the skill system implementation was **exceptionally well-designed and complete** from a technical perspective, but was **NOT yet integrated** into the main game systems at that time. See `docs/Skill System Status.md` for the current status. At the time of this evaluation, the codebase had:

1. **Legacy implementation** (`game/skills/` - 6 files) - Simple, working, but not optimized
2. **New implementation** (`skills/` - 14 files) - Highly optimized, fully tested, but not connected to EntityRegistry
3. **EntityRegistry** currently uses the legacy Object-based skill storage

**Historical status:** Production-ready code awaiting integration (Phase 1-6 from INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md). Current status is tracked in `docs/Skill System Status.md`.

---

## What's Missing ❌

### 1. Integration with Main Game Systems (CRITICAL)

**Status:** NOT INTEGRATED

The new skill system exists as standalone code but is not connected to:

- ❌ **EntityRegistry:** Still uses legacy `pl.Object` columns (`skills`, `skill_training`)
  - No `skills_df: pl.DataFrame` field
  - No `_skills_lock: Lock` field
  - No `use_vectorized_skills: bool` flag

- ❌ **Combat System:** Not calling `award_xp()` or `record_skill_usage()`
  - File: `game/systems/combat_system.py`
  - Missing: XP awards after combat
  - Missing: Skill usage tracking
  - Missing: Combat bonus calculations

- ❌ **Save/Load System:** Skills not persisted
  - File: `game/entities/registry.py`
  - Missing: `integrate_with_registry_save()` in save method
  - Missing: `extract_from_registry_save()` in load method

- ❌ **Startup Initialization:** Numba warmup not called
  - File: Likely `main.py` or orchestrator
  - Missing: `from skills.utils import numba_warmup; numba_warmup()`

**Impact:** Skill system has zero effect on gameplay currently

**Resolution:** Follow `skills/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` Phases 1-6 (2-3 days work)

---

### 2. UI/UX Layer (IMPORTANT)

**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED

The skill system has no user interface:

- ❌ **Skill Screen:** No way to view skill levels/progress
  - Typical keybinding: `m` (like DCSS)
  - Should display: Current levels, XP progress, training status

- ❌ **Training Controls:** No UI for manual mode
  - Cannot enable/disable skills
  - Cannot set FOCUSED vs NORMAL states
  - Cannot set target levels

- ❌ **Level-Up Notifications:** No feedback when skills increase
  - Should announce: "Your Fighting skill increased to level 5!"
  - Integration point: Return value from `award_xp()`

- ❌ **Character Sheet Integration:** Skills not shown in stats
  - Missing: HP bonus from Fighting
  - Missing: Damage multipliers
  - Missing: MP from Spellcasting

**Impact:** Players cannot see or interact with skill system

**Resolution:** Implement UI layer (1-2 days work after integration)

---

### 3. Advanced Features (NICE-TO-HAVE)

**Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

Features mentioned in design but not fully integrated:

#### 3.1 Skill Manuals
- ⚠️ **Partial:** `ManualBonus` dataclass exists in `models.py`
- ❌ **Missing:** Item integration (no consumable items that grant bonuses)
- ❌ **Missing:** Manual consumption logic
- ❌ **Missing:** Duration tracking (XP countdown)

**Use Case:** Temporary +4 aptitude boost items (like DCSS)

#### 3.2 Shapeshifting Forms
- ⚠️ **Partial:** Form modifier structures exist in design doc
- ❌ **Missing:** Form state tracking in EntityRegistry
- ❌ **Missing:** Form-specific bonus calculations
- ❌ **Missing:** Integration with `Shapeshifting` skill

**Use Case:** Beast/Dragon/Statue forms with skill modifications

#### 3.3 Skill Prerequisites
- ❌ **Missing:** Entirely unimplemented
- ❌ **Missing:** Prerequisite validation logic
- ❌ **Missing:** Gating for advanced skills

**Use Case:** Require Fighting 5 before training weapon skills

#### 3.4 Skill Synergies
- ❌ **Missing:** Entirely unimplemented
- ❌ **Missing:** Synergy bonus calculations
- ❌ **Missing:** Combination effects

**Use Case:** Fighting + Armour = extra HP bonus

#### 3.5 Skill Rust (Decay)
- ❌ **Missing:** Entirely unimplemented
- ❌ **Missing:** Decay mechanics
- ❌ **Missing:** Hardcore mode integration

**Use Case:** Unused skills decay over time

#### 3.6 Dynamic Aptitudes
- ❌ **Missing:** Entirely unimplemented
- ❌ **Missing:** Temporary aptitude modifiers
- ❌ **Missing:** Mutation/effect system integration

**Use Case:** Mutations that change aptitudes

#### 3.7 Milestone Abilities
- ❌ **Missing:** Entirely unimplemented
- ❌ **Missing:** Skill trees with special unlocks
- ❌ **Missing:** Ability system integration

**Use Case:** Unlock special moves at skill milestones (e.g., Axes 10 = Cleave)

**Impact:** Limited - these are enhancements, not core functionality

**Resolution:** Can be added incrementally post-integration

---

### 4. Magic School Cross-Training (MINOR GAP)

**Status:** INCOMPLETE

Current cross-training only covers:
- ✅ Weapon skills (Axes ↔ Maces, etc.)
- ✅ Blade skills (Long ↔ Short)
- ❌ **Missing:** Fire ↔ Ice interaction (mentioned in design doc but commented out)
- ❌ **Missing:** Air ↔ Earth interaction
- ❌ **Missing:** Opposing school penalties (Fire vs Ice should have negative cross-training)

**Current Code (`skills/models.py:181-197`):**
```python
CROSS_TRAINING_PAIRS: Final[tuple[CrossTrainingPair, ...]] = (
    # Axes <-> Maces & Flails
    CrossTrainingPair(Skill.AXES, Skill.MACES_AND_FLAILS, 0.40),
    # ... weapon skills only ...
    # NOTE: No magic school cross-training implemented
)
```

**Impact:** Magic users miss out on cross-training benefits

**Resolution:** Add magic school relationships to `CROSS_TRAINING_PAIRS` (30 minutes)

---

### 5. Species-Specific Aptitudes (MINOR GAP)

**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED

Currently, aptitudes are per-skill but not per-species:

- ❌ **Missing:** Species aptitude tables (Humans +0, Trolls +3 Fighting, etc.)
- ❌ **Missing:** Species-aptitude initialization logic
- ❌ **Missing:** Species integration with character creation

**Current Behavior:** All entities get default aptitudes (assumed 0)

**Impact:** Reduced strategic diversity (all species learn at same rate)

**Resolution:** Add species aptitude table and initialization (1-2 hours)

---

### 6. Experience Point Sources (INTEGRATION GAP)

**Status:** NOT CONNECTED

The skill system can distribute XP, but nothing is generating it:

- ❌ **Combat XP:** Not awarded after successful attacks/kills
- ❌ **Spell XP:** Not awarded after spell casting
- ❌ **Stealth XP:** Not awarded for sneaking
- ❌ **Exploration XP:** Not awarded for discovering areas

**Current State:** `award_xp()` exists but is never called

**Impact:** Skills never level up during gameplay

**Resolution:** Hook into combat/magic/stealth systems (part of integration)

---

### 7. Testing Gaps (MINOR)

**Status:** MOSTLY COMPLETE

Test coverage is excellent, but missing:

- ❌ **Integration Tests:** No end-to-end tests with EntityRegistry
  - File: Should add `tests/test_skill_integration.py`
  - Coverage: Combat → XP → Level-up workflow

- ❌ **Stress Tests:** No tests with 100k+ entities
  - Current: Tested up to 10k entities
  - Missing: Large-scale performance validation

- ❌ **Concurrency Tests:** No multi-threaded tests
  - Missing: Race condition detection
  - Missing: Deadlock detection

**Impact:** Minor - core functionality well-tested

**Resolution:** Add integration and stress tests (1 day)

## Comparison: Legacy vs New System

| Feature | Legacy (`game/skills/`) | New (`skills/`) |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Storage** | `pl.Object` dict | `pl.DataFrame` |
| **Performance** | Pure Python | Numba + Polars |
| **Type Safety** | Basic | `mypy --strict` |
| **Cross-Training** | Basic dict | Sparse matrix |
| **Thread Safety** | None | `_skills_lock` |
| **Tests** | Minimal | Comprehensive |
| **Documentation** | README only | 4 markdown files |
| **XP Distribution** | O(n) loops | Vectorized |
| **Save/Load** | Pickle | msgpack |
| **Integration** | ✅ Connected | ❌ Not connected |

**Recommendation:** Complete integration, deprecate legacy system

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Core skill system is stable and well-tested
- Integration plan is thorough with rollback strategy
- Performance targets already met

### Medium Risk
- Integration may introduce bugs in EntityRegistry
- Thread safety requires careful review during integration
- Save/load format changes may break existing saves

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use feature flag (`use_vectorized_skills`) for gradual rollout
- Run parity tests to verify legacy behavior matches
- Implement save migration logic for backward compatibility
- Extensive integration testing before merging

---

## Conclusion

**The skill system is production-ready code that is exceptionally well-designed.**

**Critical Gap:** It is not integrated into the game. All the infrastructure exists, but:
- EntityRegistry doesn't use it
- Combat system doesn't call it
- Save/load doesn't persist it
- UI doesn't display it

**Next Steps:**
1. Execute `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` Phases 1-6 (~5 days)
2. Add magic cross-training (30 min)
3. Implement species aptitudes (2 hours)
4. Build basic skill UI (1 day)

**Timeline to Production:**
- Minimum viable: ~5 days
- Full featured: ~8 days
- With advanced features: ~20 days

**Verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) for code quality, ⚠️ (0/5) for integration status

The skill system is **not missing functionality** - it's missing **integration**.
